# 2. Refine opportunity statements with stakeholders.![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/l_9_gHuhAOrmD3Rv3k9UkbfdtbDsIeI0mcR4MJPf2juUCla-Mr6vXRd7fdAUmXq3OyOp03tjZumfnHJhQWNPTPWHjenDtILMLKdJaEhqCfdwiCx_GZxXt0STeERPIwEPFsyBzj2G "Screen Shot 2017-07-18 at 5.19.16 PM.png")

**THE ACTION:** Collect context and information from specific stakeholders to narrow your focus area down to detailed scenarios that expose opportunities to support the use of open data.

**THE RESULT:** A few promising opportunity statements that outline the potential impact of supporting specific open data use scenarios.

**THE COLLABORATORS:** Stakeholders who have academic or lived experience and insight into your chosen focus area, and who can refine the scenarios for potential open data use.

**DESCRIPTION:** An opportunity statement should capture details about a specific scenario in which stakeholders have expressed an opportunity for you to help them better use open data. It’s not just a problem statement, it’s a more descriptive and fully-formed view of the granular scenarios in which stakeholders want to use open data within your focus area. Working with stakeholders to develop detailed descriptions of their data use scenarios will help you clarify the opportunity that will drive your TDE work forward. It ensures that the intervention that eventuallysupportsyour expressed opportunity for community use of open data has end users and addresses actual community needs.

Focus area stakeholders are experts in their own neighborhoods, communities, and challenges, and listening to their knowledge on specific local issues will help refine the details around specific opportunities. Hearing about their data use scenarios and incorporating their thoughts into what you determine are “promising” opportunity statements will help residents feel like their experiences matter in ultimately crafting a TDE intervention. To complete this step, you should choose to build opportunity statements off of data use scenarios with particularly strong community partner support, strong resident interest, or obviously relevant gaps in information or data.

### Tactics to help you Refine with collaborators:

| TACTIC | DESCRIPTION |
| :--- | :--- |
| Interview stakeholders individually | Survey or interview individual stakeholders who have interacted with the city around your chosen focus area. Individuals with relevant perspectives may include individuals who requested data \(about your chosen issue\), who work in relevant fields, who commonly interact with services, or who are most greatly affected by issues within your focus area. Mine their responses for details about their open data needs and the potential impacts of addressing those needs, and use that insight to generate one or more opportunity statements. |
| Host a “scope-a-thon” | Host an event where local nonprofits, researchers, civic hackers, government officials, journalists, and other stakeholders can gather to brainstorm what the most pertinent opportunities are for open data’s use within your chosen focus area. Scope specific stakeholders’ needs and find details about how better open data might generate impact. Collaboratively generate one or more promising, detailed opportunity statements. |
| Consult data users and experts | Convene a user group meeting with local “experts” to generate ideas for which opportunities within your focus area might be most pressing or feasible to address with data. Leverage local knowledge and data user feedback to find how open data can fit into solutions for residents. Collect subject matter detail on how addressing open data needs might play a role in community impact. |
| Consult the public | Attend meetings or plan a community meeting centered around your focus area. Collect detail on specific issues, for example by conduct low-tech, digital, verbal, or physical exercises and try to tailor activities to a wide range of experience levels for the general public. “[Data days](http://bniajfi.org/data_day/)”, “[data walks](http://www.urban.org/research/publication/data-walks-innovative-way-share-data-communities),” or similar events, where residents can see and comment on data in person, or other hands-on activities could help residents express specific details about opportunities for better data or information within a focus area. |
| Workshop with partners | Gather your trusted partners and brainstorm ways that each partner can reach out to their own community network and assess what specific needs within your focus area might benefit from the use of open data. Host workshops to come up with a specific opportunity statements based on expressed community needs. |
