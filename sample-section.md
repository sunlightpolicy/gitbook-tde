# Preface

Since the beginning of the What Works Cities project, the Sunlight Foundation \(Sunlight\) has worked to build a foundation for open data nationwide by helping nearly 40 U.S. cities enact open data policies, and by tracking open data policies in over 100 cities, counties, and states. Sunlight’s efforts to build policies and portals have fostered and ensured democratic access to government data across the nation.

To fully engender openness and to get the most out of their open data programs, governments need to build upon this infrastructure of access. We designedTactical Data Engagementto help cities gobeyond a policy and portal,and facilitate opportunities forthe community use of open datato improve residents’ lives.

Sunlight believes that [information is power](https://sunlightfoundation.com/about/) and that all residents have the the right to power through the access and use of public information. Community actors need public data and information to have an evidence base for addressing local challenges, which presents a clear opportunity for governments to facilitate the use of open data for problem-solving.

Our vision is that city halls and other governments will use Tactical Data Engagement to proliferate the use of open data in all communities,with particular attention on marginalized communities that often go overlooked as audiences for civic technology, open data, and transparency. Tactical Data Engagement presents a uniquely valuable opportunity for city halls to empower residents from systemically disenfranchised communities who need open data and public information to address local challenges.

This guide’s approach to facilitating the community use of open data is, at its core, about putting radical value in residents’ needs and in the outcomes that governments and residents can achieve when working transparently to use open data. This guide encourages readers to ask: What can governmentsdoto actively facilitate opportunities for open data use in communities? Where are information gaps that governments might help to close? And how can government become an equal partner with residents in leveraging open data for community impact?
