**THE ACTION:** Observe, listen to, and analyze community voices to discover general focus areas with opportunities for the community use of open data.

**THE RESULT:** A single focus area where community voices and needs suggest the most impactful opportunities for the community use of open data.

**THE COLLABORATOR:** A broad group of community members who can illuminate potentially impactful focus areas.

**DESCRIPTION:** In order to facilitate the community use of open data, cities need to identify a broad focus area where there are a number of opportunities to do so. You may already be listening to residents’ concerns and needs by conducting surveys, maintaining relationships with trusted/anchor organizations in the community, or regularly convening community stakeholders. Use any channels available to you to listen for opportunities where public data or information would empower residents to better understand, address, or collaborate to solve a local issue. Often, the most impactful opportunities for governments to close information gaps lie with residents of communities that are disproportionately missing or excluded from conversations about public data and decision-making. Observe whether a majority of promising opportunities for the use of open data in those communities are clustered around a single issue or focus area. After listening to a variety of challenges that might require the community use of open data, you may choose a focus area by aligning those opportunities with the city’s on-going strategic priorities. Choose a focus area to pursue that would impactfully increase the community use of open data.

### Tactics to help you Find with collaborators:

| TACTIC | DESCRIPTION |
| :--- | :--- |
| Seek out shared priorities | Ask members of the community which issues are their priorities. Are any of these priorities in alignment with City Hall’s strategic goals? If so, these areas of overlap will make for a promising focus area with built in community stakeholders, especially if there are hints that access to information can help community members address relevant issues. |
| Analyze data/ information requests | Analyze any formal or informal channels where residents or data users submitted requests for data, information, files, or services, such as public records requests. Choose a focus area based on where requests are most concentrated. |
| Identify most valuable partners | Look for partners in the community with whom your agency has contracts, data-sharing agreements, or other similar trusted relationships — for example, partners who receive government grants. Issues of importance to these partners may be impactful focus areas for their \(or their stakeholders’\) use of open data. |
| Observe popular meetings | Attend meetings where residents attend to voice pressing, current concerns. Listen and determine whether concerns center around a focus area, and whether residents need support in using open data or information to address that focus area. |
| Map impactful focus areas | Study which focus areas other governments have had success addressing through the community use of open data and whether you can partner with them, learn from them, or replicate their solutions. Using this tactic means you’ll have to ensure that focus areas important in similar places are also important to your community’s residents. |
