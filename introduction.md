# Introduction

## What is Tactical Data Engagement?

#### Tactical Data Engagement is a four-step method for governments to facilitate impactful community use of open data.

This guide puts forth a vision for Tactical Data Engagement \(TDE\), a method based on core concepts of [human-centered design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human-centered_design) and [tactical urbanism](https://issuu.com/streetplanscollaborative/docs/tactical_urbanism_vol_2_final), with steps that guide city officials in carrying out interventions that facilitate the community use of open data for local impact. This approach goes beyond basic resident engagement. It seeks to make open data programs more transparent, accountable, and participatory by challenging city halls to actively help residents use open data to better their communities.

The four steps outlined in this guide lead the reader to complete a resident-informed project, product, or tool that supports the community use of data.

Readers can carry out each of these steps “tactically” — using lightweight, adaptable, incremental, and inexpensive tactics that can be realistically catered to fit within a city hall’s or community’s unique constraints and capacities. The tactics are drawn from examples of good resident engagement around the country, and ensure that in every step, residents are collaborators in determining promising opportunities for impact through the community use of open data.

## Who should use Tactical Data Engagement?

#### The primary audiences for this guide are city officials and other public servants who want to work with community actors to get more value out of open data and information.

The TDE method is primarily for city officials who want to help residents generate impact and success stories using open data. However, this guide is also designed to be adaptable to meet the needs of a broad range of readers.

If you’re a government with the foundations of an open data program, TDE can help you take that program to the next level by building on your policy and/or portal. If you are just starting out, TDE can help you begin sharing the right data with the right people and generating open data success stories.

If you’re an advocate, researcher, librarian, or organizer who wants to incorporate the use of open data into your existing work with communities — or seek out opportunities to partner with governments in facilitating the community use of open data — we think TDE will have a lot to offer you as well.

This broad applicability stems from TDE’s lightweight and adaptable tactics. The tactics are designed to be used by readers who are tight on time and resources. Tactics can be applied to align with on-going activities and strategies, and they range in the level of effort and impact, thus providing options for governments with varying technical, data, or outreach capacity.

Whoever you are, we hope you enjoy reading about the TDE method, and are able to put our tactics to work!
