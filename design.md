# 3. Design a plan with intended users.![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/x6Ar9x3bVpSO5rTJGyJ4D3d_MgLsrOpB0RDsMSHvudR5dpmfr0h_kU6gzXxcnwPSVd1QyATigQOnajeo8P1vyWvtC1t3DNJXfl6rm93bQW81B6UhY2caCCD-wTk0no8mqsw9TLCX "Screen Shot 2017-07-18 at 5.19.26 PM.png")

_\*Note: You are not carrying out an intervention in this step, but rather putting together the specifics of the plan that you will carry out. You will need to know the _[_implementation tactics_](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YYwrMM_-8vMEAQ-GHPzdm6as4PLPDJG_0F36uje4nr4/edit#heading=h.rrcffgq50mqz)_ and plan ahead accordingly if you plan to carry out an implementation tactic._

**THE ACTION:** Working with your intended users, collaboratively draft a plan for an intervention that supports the need for open data in one of your opportunity statements.

**THE RESULT:** A user-informed plan that outlines an intervention to actively support and facilitate your chosen opportunity for open data use.

**THE COLLABORATORS:** Intended users of open data, based on the target audience for a specific intervention to support your most chosen opportunity for open data use.

**DESCRIPTION:** Examine your opportunity statements and begin mapping interventions like products, projects, or tools that may address stakeholders’ expressed needs from the previous step. Choose a single opportunity that has the most potential for an effective intervention, taking into account both your capacity and stakeholder interest. Limiting the opportunities in this step is crucial for taking a tactical, focused approach to facilitating the community use of open data -- one opportunity at a time. Narrow down which specific stakeholders are intended users and work more closely with them to plan an intervention for your chosen opportunity. The plan generated in this step should outline the intervention that supports your chosen opportunity statement and should feature feedback from intended users on how they would like to be incorporated.

Planning alongside the your intended users entails either collaboratively drafting a plan or soliciting feedback on a draft plan and incorporating responses. Collaborative planning with the intended data users in your community is essential for ensuring that planned interventions address exactly what data users need and account for details of implementation, for example, ensuring that the community agrees on who should house the project or sustain it once the government’s role is complete. A plan that hasn’t been reviewed by residents is less likely to be effective.

### Tactics to help you Design with collaborators:

| TACTIC | DESCRIPTION |
| :--- | :--- |
| Solicit user feedback | Using crowdsourced policy feedback as a model, for example, post your draft plan in the open and solicit feedback from your intended, primary audience.. Solicit comments on the plan through digital tools and update the draft accordingly. |
| Hold expert focus groups | Convene a user group meeting with local “experts”, or data users, to generate input on whether roles, timelines, and activities are appropriate for your desired outcomes. Invite your intended community data users to comment on a draft plan or collaboratively draft an action plan based on their experience in the field. Solicit in-person, detailed input pertaining to subject matter and the feasibility of your shared, desired outcomes. |
| Host public planning workshops | Invite the broader public to a community meeting where the main activity will include a low-tech engagement activity like note card sorting, diagramming, or collecting sticky note feedback on how your agency should proceed with addressing your specific opportunity for community use of open data. Commit to implementing feedback gathered at public meetings and express next steps. |
