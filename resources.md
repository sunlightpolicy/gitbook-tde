### Help getting started

The success of the TDE method relies on documenting and improving the TDE method in cities across the country.

As Sunlight’s team begins testing our tactics and documenting best practices in using TDE across the What Works Cities partnership, we’ll be regularly updating our online resources to reflect new learning and knowledge around how to implement the method. To get you started, we’ve developed a couple self-assessment tools to help you better understand your environment and foundations for using TDE.

* [“Finding tactic criteria” checklists    
  ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11-8WVgH9cYOSsbd3-y6ndm2ajzXQy5Gxjtmuny3C3n8/edit?usp=sharing)Figuring out how to get started with a major initiative can be challenging, so we developed this criteria document to help you sort through which Finding tactic \(for the first step of TDE\) might be best for you. Read the description and check off the criteria for each tactic to determine what you have and what you still might need to start a TDE project.

* [“Refining an opportunity for TDE” worksheet    
  ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lNWfq1h6Sctu8107eL3Y5BIXGmkTm6w2lOb2n8SdsjI/edit?usp=sharing)This tool is an activity intended for city or other government staff looking to do an internal brainstorming around potentially impactful TDE opportunities. This worksheet will help not substitute for actually carrying out the refining step of the TDE method. Instead, it will help you self-assess what doing this process “for real” might look like in your city. Use discussion questions to think through how you might develop an opportunity statement.

#### Coming soon…

Sunlight’s future resources on Tactical Data Engagement will be featured on an online hub for Tactical Data Engagement that will launch at the end of August 2017. The hub will have links to each of the resources here in addition to new tools, for example, an adaptable checklist for mixing and matching tactics, and real-time updates on Sunlight’s TDE pilot cities. We’re also working on updating our case study tracker for tactics “in the wild” so that readers can track the success stories of tactics from governments and organizations around the world.
