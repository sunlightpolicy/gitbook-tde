# How-To

So you’ve got a basic idea of what Tactical Data Engagement is — but how exactly do you do it?

TDE’s four-step method makes it easy and straightforward to facilitate community use of data. 

## Using the method

TDE’s steps help you start big with a focus area and broad community collaborators. Step-by-step, you’ll narrow down your scope to a tangible intervention within your capacity to implement, and you’ll engage with an increasingly specific group of collaborators in the community, resulting in a finished project where actual users will be able to address a given opportunity using open data. See Figure A for a look at how the process incrementally helps you build toward a resident-informed intervention that will maximize the impact of your community’s use of data.

To break down how each step builds toward a successful intervention that facilitates the community use of data, we mapped out the three most important components: the action, the result, and the collaborators.

In the TDE method, you start with broad goals, then slowly limit the scope of your work by consistently checking in with community collaborators. See Figures B, C, and D to visualize how narrowing down each of the three main components, the action, the result, and the collaborators, can bring you to a refined finished product that addresses the specific data needs of your community. TDE ensures that your end product is both impactful, thanks to consistent input from the community, but also lightweight and implementable, thanks to limited scope.

This process is meant to be repeated, oriterated, so that it can be applied to new opportunities for communities to use open data. Over time and various iterations, TDE will become a critical tool for engagement and collaboration with stakeholders. It should help develop a natural environment for good resident data engagement that consistently facilitates the community use of open data with varying members of the community and across various opportunities.
