# You Did It!

Congratulations! If you made it this far, you have successfully completed the Tactical Data Engagement process. You found a focus area by observing community needs; refined the opportunities for engagement by interviewing key stakeholders; designed a plan to act on one specific opportunity together with target users; and then implemented that plan to create a data intervention.

At some point during the TDE process you may have identified other opportunities to support your community’s use of open data. You can use this guide a number of times to tackle each of these opportunities in turn.

Tactical Data Engagement is about helping your community use open data resources to tackle shared challenges. And like any community improvement project, it is not a one-time thing. Making your community a better place to live takes time, effort, and regular attention. The ideas in this guide are intended to be put into regular practice. In doing so, they can help make open data a routine part of your community’s approach to addressing challenges with shared and becoming a better place for everyone who lives there.
